Press any Key to accelerate up and avoid hitting any obstacles!


You can collect different items, they are differentiated by color (all items are active for a limited time):

Green: Invulnerable, you get smaller and you can hit an obstacle once.
Blue: Double Points, all points that are acquired while this obstacle is active count as two points.
Silver: Turbo Mode, you accelerate to five times the current speed and do not hit any obstacle.
Red: Troll, all obstacles get larger, sometimes they get so large that you can't avoid them.
